                <p>
                    I am a recent MD/PhD graduate of the University of Toronto's <a href="https://medicine.utoronto.ca/">Temerty Faculty of Medicine</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/">Dalla Lana School of Public Health</a>. I have a background in computer science, AI, and digital health 
                    strategy. My expertise lies in leveraging data-driven solutions to enhance clinical decision-making, optimize health system performance, and 
                    strengthen resilience in crisis response. With 10 years of experience leading cross-functional teams, collaborating with policymakers, 
                    and developing AI-driven healthcare solutions, I thrive at the intersection of health systems, emerging digital technologies, and strategy. 
                    My work has been presented at global forums including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, published in leading academic journals such as Nature 
                    Communications and JAMA Network Open, and applied in real-world health systems. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My PhD explored how digital technology can support public health emergency response and promote resilient health systems. I was tremendously fortunate 
                    to be co-advised by <a href="https://pophealthanalytics.com/laura-rosella/">Dr. Laura Rosella</a>, Canada Research Chair in Population Health Analytics, and 
                    <a href="https://deptmedicine.utoronto.ca/news/dr-kamran-khan-appointed-inaugural-temerty-health-nexus-chair-health-innovation-and-technology">Dr. Kamran 
                    Khan</a>, infectious diseases physician and founder/CEO of <a href="https://bluedot.global/">BlueDot</a> (a Toronto-based SaaS/DaaS start-up that 
                    helps governments and private enterprises build resilience to emerging infectious diseases). During grad school, I held fellowships at the 
                    <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> and the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute for 
                        Technology and Society</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Upon completing rotations in the operating room, intensive care unit, and trauma bay, I discovered that I excel in high-stakes, dynamic environments 
                    requiring rapid problem-solving in interdisciplinary teams. I am excited to begin training in anesthesiology at the University of Toronto this July and further 
                    explore my interests in resuscitation, trauma, and pre-hospital medicine. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Previously, I was in the <a href="https://www.cs.queensu.ca/applicants/biomed/">Biomedical Computation</a> program in the
                    <a href="https://www.cs.queensu.ca/">School of Computing</a> at Queen's University. During my time at Queen's, I conducted translational
                    biomedical engineering research at the <a href="http://perk.cs.queensu.ca/">Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery</a> under the
                    supervision of <a href="https://kingstonhsc.ca/research/gabor-fichtinger">Dr. Gabor Fichtinger</a>, Canada Research Chair
                    in Computer-Integrated Surgery. My undergraduate research predominantly focused on designing and testing ultrasound-guided
                    interventions for applications in surgical oncology, cardiology, and teaching clinical trainees procedural skills
                    (e.g. line insertions and injections) within a competency-based framework.
               </p>

                    A list of publications can be found on my <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=D0hZURYAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> page.

               <p  style="margin-bottom:0">
                    When I'm not learning how to care for patients or attempting to do some science, you can find me at my local climbing gym or yoga studio,
                    cycling along the lakeshore, taking photos with my DSLR, and enjoying Toronto's unreal food scene.
